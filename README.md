# MasterThesis

This repository contains scripts and files used for my master thesis project. 
The project combines machine learning and particle physics as I have created several models using LightGBM to optimize the finding of the Z boson and Higgs particle. 

The following folders exist:
- hdf5Prod: Used for production of .h5-files from .root-files
- Zmm model: Scripts for the $Z -> \mu\mu$ model. This is split in PID and ISO models for the muons and Z model for muon pairs.
- Data model: Scripts for the $Z -> \mu\mu$ model in Data. 
- Presentation ATLAS: Presentations made during my thesis work
